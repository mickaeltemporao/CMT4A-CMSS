# Hack Time
### Setting Up A Computational Working Environment

#### GitHub first steps
1. Go to [www.github.com](https://github.com/) and identify your account name.
2. Send a message with your [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) name!
3. Create your first GitHub repository with a README.md file (`.md` files are Markdown files).
4. Edit the README file on GitHub.
    - Change the title of the file.
    - Add a new sentence.
    - Add a bullet list with three items.
5. Make your first commit!

#### RStudio and your first lines of code
1. Launch RStudio.
2. Create a new `.Rmd` document.
3. Knit (render) the document as an HTML file.
    - The first time you run this, it will ask you to install functionalities.
    - Your computer might also ask you to allow RStudio to download and install packages.
    - We need both of these functionalities so don't forget to accept!

Great! You just run your first coding script and created a webpage!

Now let's try to create PDF files.

1. Locate the console pane in RStudio. It should be the bottom left pane in RStudio.
2. Copy the following command lines in the console and hit ENTER:
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    install.packages('tinytex')
    tinytex::install_tinytex()
    ```

3. Click the small triangle right to the Knit button and choose Knit to PDF.
    - Again, the first time you do this it will download and install the functionalities required to create PDF files. It can take a couple minutes. A PDF will pop-up once the compilation successfully completed.

Great! You are now able to use markdown and the R language to make PDF files!

#### Let's make Github and RStudio work together!
Head to the [Challenges](challenges.html) page and complete the first challenge.
