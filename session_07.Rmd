# Data Modeling

We have created our first linear models and started to learn how to interpret the results of such models. The modeling part completes the data science cycle. It is an iterative and ongoing process. As a researcher we need to decide when our analysis is sufficient to test our hypothesis and shared with our peers.

# Hack Time!

```{r klippy, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
klippy::klippy()
```

1. Open a RMarkdown document and paste the following code in it: [my_project.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickaeltemporao/CMT4A-CMSS/main/my_project.Rmd)
2. Open a Text file, save it as "references.bib" and paste the following code in it: [references.bib](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickaeltemporao/CMT4A-CMSS/main/references.bib)
