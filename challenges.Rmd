## The Challenge Workflow

1. The challenge is online at least 7 days before the next session.
2. You accept the challenge by clicking the link in the section below.
3. GitHub creates and provides you a link to your challenge repository.
4. The instructions can be found in the challenges folder of the repository.
5. You start working on the challenge and making submissions.
6. Submission are considered until the start of the next session.

Late submissions will not be considered!

The first challenge (**Warm Up!**) will be completed together during the first session.
You can try to do this challenge on your own before the first session. If you're stuck, try to solve your bugs (e.g. Google your error messages). Trying to solve your errors and bugs will help you build the mindset required for this course and help you better understand the tools and software we use throughout the course.

*Note:* If you are stuck for too long in a challenge, take a break and ask for help on slack. Don't be shy, it is very likely that other students also have the same question!
