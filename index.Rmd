# Course Overview
This course introduces students to the building blocks of machine learning and artificial intelligence using real world big data and applications in political science, sociology or economics. The course follows a "learn-by-doing" approach and will place emphasis on gaining experience by analyzing real-world data and solving problems using free open source software.
The course will allow you to apply your theoretical knowledge and articulate the methods learned through various challenges and projects throughout the course. This course is designed for social science students that are not necessarily familiar with quantitative methods or computer programming.

Students must **bring a computer** to class and follow the coding sections of each session.

# Goals
1. Leverage computational methods to collect, process, visualize, analyze and model data in a fully reproducible end to end research paper.
2. Use modern free and open source software and tools to solve complex problems in the social sciences.
3. Build awareness around the ethical considerations related to big data and artificial intelligence.

# Pre-requisites
The most important prerequisite is motivation to work hard on possibly unfamiliar material.

# Grading

## Participation - 20%
Students are expected to attend every session, and to prepare the readings before each session. Students should come to class with questions about the readings and ready to engage in the different topics covered.

## Problem Sets - 30%
Before the end of each class, the teacher will share an analytical coding challenge based on the course topic. The challenges are to be solved before the start of the next course. The exercises will not be evaluated but the student will have to submit at least three of them. A successful submission includes the R or Python script with the code written by the student, the necessary comments to understand the code and solve the challenge, as well as the result of the compiled code.

## Final Project - 50%
The student must submit a final project that implements an algorithm using at least one of methods learned throughout the course and use it to a explore a research question in political science, sociology or economics. The student must write a report (between 2000 and 3000 words) presenting the problem, existing approaches, his selected approach, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm implemented and the digital trace data used. The student should consider the accountability, ethics, fairness, and transparency in its report. In addition to collecting real-word data for his project, the student will also have to demonstrate his understanding of the models used and the data collected by simulating data with the form and the biases expected by the student. In the case of a successful implementation, the algorithm chosen should correct some of the biases observed in the data. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the students ability to understand the problems related to data collection, to assess its strengths and weaknesses and to carry out a motivated and valid algorithmic implementation that can overcome an existing real-world data problem. The submission of this project includes, in addition to a final report, the R or Python scripts required to run the algorithm written by the student, the comments necessary to understand the code, the data and the results generated by the algorithm.

# Communication
Le moyen de communication privilégié pour le cours est **[Slack](https://methodesss.slack.com)**.
Si vous avez des questions en dehors des séances, posez-les directement sur [Slack](https://methodesss.slack.com) dans le *channel* approprié.
Publier publiquement ses questions/réponses nous permet à tous d'apprendre de manière dynamique.

If you have questions regarding the content of the course, please ask and answer them on *element*. If you have a question about the topic, it is likely that someone else had the same question. Posting questions and answers publicly allows us all to learn from each of these questions and answers.

Reserve emails to the instructors for personal matters.
