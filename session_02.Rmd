# Hack Time

### Interactive R

You can use the *Editor* or the *Console* to execute code.
The *Editor* allows you to easily keep track of what you are doing, so we will use it a lot!

Notice in the picture that the cursor is at line 1 in the *Editor* pane.

The most important keyboard shortcut to remember is
- **Ctrl + Enter** for Windows/Linux users.
- **Cmd + Enter** for MacOs users.

This shortcut send the current line in the *Editor* to the *Console*, executes it and puts the cursor on the next line in the *Editor*.

If you type code in the *Console*, it will be directly executed when you press *Enter*.

#### Let's try!


Launch RStudio, open an empty R Script and run the following lines.

- *Tip:* Use R Scripts to take notes during each session!

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Session 2: Programming Basics"
print("Greetings!")

# What do you see when you run the code below?
```{r eval=FALSE}
print(" _____")
# This is a comment.
print("|     |")
## Here's another comment.
print("|     |")
### And yet another comment.
print("|_____|")
print("Each line is executed sequentially.")

# Notice that in R scripts (`.R`) the lines starting with an # are comments.

# Try to print your first and last name:
```


### Coding basics

In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator.

_Arithmetic operators:_

- Addition:       +
- Subtraction:    -
- Multiplication: *
- Division:       /
- Exponentiation: ^
- Modulo:         %%


```{r eval=FALSE}

```

### Using functions

### Installing and loading packages

### Make your own functions

### Code blocks

### Bibliographies in `.Rmd` files
