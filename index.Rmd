# Course Overview
This course introduces students to the building blocks of machine learning and artificial intelligence using real world big data and applications in political science, sociology or economics. The course follows a "learn-by-doing" approach and will place emphasis on gaining experience by analyzing real-world data and solving problems using free open source software.
The course will allow you to apply your theoretical knowledge and articulate the methods learned through various challenges and projects throughout the course. This course is designed for social science students that are not necessarily familiar with quantitative methods or computer programming.


# Goals
1. Leverage computational methods to collect, process, visualize, analyze and model data in a fully reproducible end to end research paper.
2. Use modern free and open source software and tools to solve complex problems in the social sciences.
3. Build awareness around the ethical considerations related to big data and artificial intelligence.


# Pre-requisites
The most important prerequisite is motivation to work hard on possibly unfamiliar material.


# Grading
## Participation - 20%

## Problem Sets - 30%

## Final Project - 50%

# Communication
The main communication tool that we will use during the course will be

If you have questions regarding the content of the course, please ask and answer them on *element*. If you have a question about the topic, it is likely that someone else had the same question. Posting questions and answers publicly allows us all to learn from each of these questions and answers.

Reserve emails to the instructors for personal matters.

# Materials & requirements

Students need to have access to a computer in order to follow the coding sections of each session.

## Software

This course uses [R](https://www.r-project.org/), which is a free and open-source programming language primarily used for statistics and data analysis. We also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an easy-to-use interface to program in R and other languages.

Instructions to install or upgrade R can be found [here](https://cran.biotools.fr/).

This course will also use [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control. This will allow you to track your changes and help you do reproducible research.

Homework assignments will be distributed and submitted via [GitHub Classrooms](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms).

If this does not yet make sense, don't worry; we'll cover it in the course.

Students have access to a [DataCamp classroom](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education). You can use this resource for additional practice.

Make sure you have downloaded the following software before the first day of class:
- R
- RStudio
- LaTeX
