# Data wrangling

We use real data to illustrate the various concepts. We rely on a popular dataset often used to study public opinion and political behaviour: The American National Election Study from 2016 (ANES 2016).

- Download the User Guide and Codebook: https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2016-time-series-study/

We use `dplyr`'s verbs to solve common data manipulation challenges:

- `select()` picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions.
- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.
- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.

# Session 3: Data Management 1/2 ----


# Getting Started ====
# Load the tidyverse package
...

## ...
data_url <- "https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/CMT4A-CMSS-TEMPLATE/blob/main/data/ts_2016.rds"

## ...
if(!file.exists("ts_2016.rds")) {
  download.file(data_url, "ts_2016.rds")
}

## ...
dataset <- readRDS("ts_2016.rds")

# Check the dataset
# class, head, dim, etc.
...


# The Select Verb & The Pipe ====

# ...
dataset %>%
  select(V161005, V161267, V161126, V161031, V161155)

# Select a single variable
...

# Select the previous 5 variables and store them into a new object called `tmp_data`
...


# The Filter Verb ====
# Keep only respondents who voted in 2012
dataset %>%
  filter(V161005 == 1)

## Keep respondents below 25 years old
...

## Keep respondents below 25 years who are not missing and who voted
...

# Select the previous 5 variables, filter them and store them into a new object called `tmp_data`

# The Arrange Verb ====
# Sort respondents by age
tmp_data %>%
  arrange(V161267)

# Select 5 variables, filter young voters and arrange observations by age
...


# Store the output in a new object called young_voters
...

# Return young voters in descending order


# The Mutate Verb ====

## TIP: Always check your variables with table()

# Change an existing column/variable
table(young_voters$V161126)
...

# Create a new variable/column
table(young_voters$V161031)
...

# Combine select, filter, mutate, and arrange
...
