# Course Overview
This course introduces students to the building blocks of machine learning and artificial intelligence using real world "Big Data" and applications in political science, sociology or economics. The goal is to introduce to new computational social science methods and tools required to explore and harness the potential of "Big Data". Learning such methods and tools requires practice. This course follows a "learn-by-doing" approach and will place emphasis on gaining experience by analyzing real-world data and solving problems using cutting edge yet free open source software. It will allow you to apply your theoretical knowledge and articulate the methods learned in an end to end research project throughout the course. The course is designed for social science students that are not necessarily familiar with quantitative methods or computer programming.

## Goals
1. Ability to motivate the usage of computational methods in a fully reproducible end to end academic research paper.

2. Ability to discuss the reliability of inferences drawn from computational methods relying on "Big---non-probabilistic---Data".

3. Equip you with the ethical, theoretical, and methodological tools of tomorrow, allowing you to harness the potential of "Big Data", machine learning and artificial intelligence.


# Grading
## Participation (30%)
Participation is divided into three parts: activities, live demos, and a-sync participation.

- **Activities:** Students are expected to practice every week in DataCamp in order to be prepared for the live sessions. The goal is to provide students with opportunities to continuously practice and learn incrementally. Before the first session you should have received an email invitation to the course on DataCamp.

- **Live demos:** Students are expected to do a live demo that helps the class understand a topic during a session. A demo is an hands-on demonstration that introduces a programming or a statistical concept and illustrates how to use it through an example in RStudio. Each demo should last no longer than 10 minutes.

- **A-Sync:** Students are expected to be active on our dedicated communication Slack channels, that is asking questions and helping other students when they have questions. For more details regarding the Slack check the [Communication section](#Communication) below.

## Coding challenges (30%)
Learning computational methods requires lots of practice. The goal of these coding challenges is to provide students with opportunities to to apply what they learn during live sessions in new but similar contexts. For more details regarding the coding challenges see the [Challenges page](challenges.html).

## Research project (40%)
Students are required to submit an individual research paper that uses some of the methods and tools introduced in the course. Your project will introduce a motivated forecasting machine learning model of the 2016 United States Presidential election. You will discuss the challenges related to the data you are using, carry out a motivated and valid algorithmic implementation, and assess the strengths and weaknesses of your data and model(s). More details about the project and the deadlines will be made available in the second semester in the [Project page](project.html).


# Requirements
The most important requirement is motivation to work hard on likely unfamiliar material. The second most important requirement is to have access to a computer in order to participate and complete the assignments. Finally, make sure you have completed the [Onboarding](onboarding.html) section before the first session.

From there, we will learn as we go!


# Communication
Before the first session you should receive an email invitation to join our [Slack](https://spb-methods.slack.com) channel (until we find a good open-source alternative).

Use slack for questions regarding the content of the course, ask and answer them on our [Slack](https://spb-methods.slack.com) channel. Being active on Slack and answering your peers’ questions is encouraged and will positively impact your participation grade. Furthermore, if you have a question about the topic, it is likely that someone else had the same question. Posting questions and answers publicly allows us all to learn from each of these questions and answers.
