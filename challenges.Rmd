title: Challenges

The challenge workflow is:

1. The challenge is online at least 7 days before the next session.
2. You accept the challenge by clicking the link in the section below.
3. GitHub creates and provides you a link to your challenge repository.
4. The instructions can be found in the challenges folder of the repository.
5. You start working on the challenge and making submissions.
6. Submission are considered until the start of the next session.

Late submissions will not be considered!


The first challenge (Challenge 0: Warm Up!) will be completed together during the first session.
You can and should try to do this challenge on your own before the first session. Even if you're stuck, it will help you understand the main tools we will use throughout the course.

*Note:* If you are stuck in a challenge, ask for help on slack. Don't be shy, it is very likely that other students also have the same question!
