title: Challenges
---

Challenges will be graded based on the best four out of six individual grades.

The challenge workflow is:

1. The challenge is online at least 7 days before the next session.
2. Students start working on the challenge and making submissions on GitHub Classrooms.
3. The last submission is due before the start of the next session.

Assignments will be graded following a 4-category scale:

---- -------------------------------------------------
✓+   exceptional, above and beyond what was expected
✓    completed with good effort
✓-   acceptable, but major deficiencies
∅    unacceptable; did not submit
---- -------------------------------------------------
