- Learn how code is executed in an interactive environment.
- Become familiar with R coding syntax, functions and packages.
- Leverage R code blocks and `.bib` files in `.Rmd` files.


# Interactive R

You can use the *Editor* or the *Console* to execute code.
The *Editor* allows you to easily keep track of what you are doing, so we will use it a lot!

Notice in the picture that the cursor is at line 1 in the *Editor* pane.

The most important keyboard shortcut to remember is
- **Ctrl + Enter** for Windows/Linux users.
- **Cmd + Enter** for MacOs users.

This shortcut send the current line in the *Editor* to the *Console*, executes it and puts the cursor on the next line in the *Editor*.

If you type code in the *Console*, it will be directly executed when you press *Enter*.


### Hack Time!

Launch RStudio, open an empty R Script and run the following lines.

- *TIP:* Use R Scripts to take notes during each session!

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Programming Basics"
print("Greetings!")

# Notice that in R scripts (`.R`) the lines starting with an # are comments.

# Try to print your first and last name:

# What do you see when you run the lines below?
print(" _____")
# This is a comment.
print("|     |")
## Here's another comment.
print("|     |")
### And yet another comment.
print("|_____|")
print("Each line is executed sequentially.")
```

# Coding basics

## Arithmetic Operators

In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator.

|Operator        | Symbol|
|-               | :-:  |
| Addition       | +  |
| Subtraction    | -  |
| Multiplication | *  |
| Division       | /  |
| Exponentiation | ^  |
| Modulo         | %% |


### Hack Time!
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Do the following:
# Divide 7 by 3.

# Raise 2 to the 5 power.

# Do something else.

# Describe what you did using a comment
```

## Objects and assignment

Objects are containers that allow you to store something (e.g. 5).

- R uses the symbol `<-` as the assignment statement.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# I'm assigning the value 5 to a new object called new_object
new_object <- 5
new_object
```
You can inspect an object by typing its name. Did you notice that in this case we did not use the `print()` function and yet the Console returned a value? The R Console will always return the last statement.

### Hack Time!
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create your own object and describe what
# you are doing using a comment.

# Assign numerical values to two variables named `day_1` and `day_2`.

# Add these two variables together.

# Create a `my_total` variable containing the sum of the day `day_1` and `day_2` variables.

# Print the contents of the `my_total` variable.

```

Object names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, _ (underscores) and . (dots). You want your object names to be descriptive.

R is case sensitive! Limit yourself to lowercase characters and you will not have to worry about this.
*TIP:* Only use lowercase words separated with `_` when creating objects.

```{r eval=FALSE}
this <- 5
# is different than
This
```

## Basic data types

- A *numeric* is a decimal values like 4.2.
- An *integer* is whole number like 4. It is also a numeric.
- A *logical* is a boolean like TRUE or FALSE.
- A *character* is a text or string like "potato".

```{r eval=FALSE}
vote_share_1 = 50.8
vote_share_2 = 47.2
class(vote_share_1)

party_1 = "Democratic"
party_2 = "Republican"
class(party_1)

party_1_winner = TRUE
party_2_winner = FALSE
class(party_1_winner)
```

### Hack Time!
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Your Code Here.
## Create a new variable containing the total percentage of the votes counted.

## Print the type of this new variable.

```

# Functions
Everything in a R that follows the pattern `something()` is a function. That is, a series of characters followed by an open and closed parenthesis.

You've already used some functions previously. Which ones?

One very important function is the `help()` function

Check type of objects

Built in functions
