# Objective

Articulate political science theories, statistical and computational methods in a reproducible research project. You will demonstrate that you can effectively combine prose, code, and results to answer a research question.

# Context

You are a young data scientist working for a polling agency during the 2016 United States Presidential election. Ideology is known to be one of the main predictors of voting behavior [@jessee2012ideology]. You are tasked to understand and forecast individuals' ideology (your target) using the ANES 2016 dataset. You are expected to submit a research project of that introduces a machine learning algorithm predicting ideological self-placement (V161126) using the ANES 2016 dataset. The project can use any of the methods introduced during the course, but is not limited to. You will explain the methods and the variables you choose to incorporate in your algorithm and why those are appropriate to predict your target. You can use theory or data to motivate your choices. You will also discuss the assumptions made by the methods and the data and the limits of what we can learn from your project.

# Instructions

The project starter code will be automatically created for you when you accept the assignment.

Your submission will consist of at least three files:

1. a RMarkdown script (`.Rmd`),
2. a bibliography file (`.bib`) and
3. a rendered PDF document (`.pdf`)

**The RMarkdown script**:

- Contains all the code necessary to reproduce the project.
- Uses code chunks that are understandable to the reader.
- Loads, cleans and prepares the data.
- Makes summary statistics and appropriate visualizations of the target variable and explanatory variables you select.
- Trains an algorithm using the selected variables in the ANES 2016 dataset.
- Uses the trained algorithm to make predictions of the target variable.
- Evaluates and summarises the performance of the algorithm.
    - You will use appropriate tables and visualizations.
- Uses prose to describe the algorithmic implementation and variable choices to the reader.
    - You will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the data and your algorithm.
- Uses relevant citations when appropriate to ground the project theoretically.
- Contains a bibliography section with the all the used references.
- The script successfully knits.

**The bibliography file:**

- Contains all the used references
- The references are properly used in the main RMarkdown script

**The PDF document:**

- The rendered PDF document is no longer than 2500 words.

# Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based five criteria:

- Algorithm:  The computational methods applied to the data are appropriate.
- Code quality: The code is of good quality and appropriately documented.
- Document structure: The document is well formatted and uses the right tools.
- Expression: The methods used and the variables selected or created are properly motivated using theory and empirics.
- Originality: The algorithmic implementation is original and uses a good depth of course material.
