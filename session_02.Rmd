# Interactive R

You can use the *Editor* or the *Console* to execute code.
The *Editor* allows you to easily keep track of what you are doing, so we will use it a lot!

Notice in the picture that the cursor is at line 1 in the *Editor* pane.

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8a64bb047429d7ae0e2acae35c40e421e6439bf6/80e5d/diagrams/rstudio-editor.png "RStudio IDE")

The most important keyboard shortcut to remember is:

- **Ctrl + Enter** for Windows/Linux users.
- **Cmd + Enter** for MacOs users.

This shortcut send the current line in the *Editor* to the *Console*, executes it and puts the cursor on the next line in the *Editor*.

If you type code in the *Console*, it will be directly executed when you press *Enter*.


### Hack Time!

Launch RStudio, open an empty R Script and run the following lines.

- *TIP:* Use R Scripts to take notes during each session!

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Programming Basics"
print("Greetings!")

# Notice that in R scripts (`.R`) the lines starting with an # are comments.

# Try to print your first and last name:

# What do you see when you run the lines below?
print(" _____")
# This is a comment.
print("|     |")
## Here's another comment.
print("|     |")
### And yet another comment.
print("|_____|")
print("Each line is executed sequentially.")
```

Let's create our first real figure by running the following lines:

```{r eval=FALSE}
my_plotting_function <- function() {
  # A simple plotting function
  my_title <- "My first figure"
  growth <- seq(1:10)

  plot(x=growth, main=my_title)
  lines(growth)
}

my_plotting_function()
```

Does this look complicated? Don't worry, by the end of the session, you should be able to understand what's happening here!


# Coding basics

## Arithmetic Operators

In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator.

|Operator        | Symbol|
|-               | :-:   |
| Addition       | +  |
| Subtraction    | -  |
| Multiplication | *  |
| Division       | /  |
| Exponentiation | ^  |
| Modulo         | %% |


### Hack Time!
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Do the following:
# Divide 7 by 3.

# Raise 2 to the 5 power.

# Do another calculation.

# Describe what you did using a comment
```

## Objects and assignment

Objects are containers that allow you to store something (e.g. 5).

- R uses the symbol `<-` as the assignment statement.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# I'm assigning the value 5 to a new object called new_object
new_object <- 5
new_object

New_object  # What's wrong here?
```
You can inspect an object by typing its name. Did you notice that in this case we did not use the `print()` function and yet the Console returned a value?

- The R Console will always return the last statement.

#### Object names

- R is case sensitive!
- must start with a letter
- can only contain letters, numbers, _ (underscores) and . (dots).
- object names should be descriptive

*TIP:* use lowercase words separated by `_` when naming your objects.

### Hack Time!
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create your own object and describe what you are doing in a comment.

# Assign numerical values to two variables named `day_1` and `day_2`.

# Add these two variables together.

# Create a `my_total` variable containing the sum of the day `day_1` and `day_2` variables.

# Print the contents of the `my_total` variable.

```

## Basic data types

|Type         | Description      | Example |
| -           | -                | -       |
| *numeric*   | Decimal values   | 4.2     |
| *integer*   | Whole numbers (also *numeric*) | 4 |
| *logical*   | Booleans         | TRUE or FALSE |
| *character* | A text or string | "The Democratic Party" |

### Hack Time!
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Check the class of each object using the class() function
vote_share <- 50.8

party <- "Democratic"

is_winner <- vote_share > 50
```

# Functions

In a R any series of characters followed by an open and closed "()" parenthesis with or without any inputs is a function.

- `my_object <- my_function(input)`
- The function contains related statements that perform a specific task.
- They help breaking our code into smaller and modular chunks.
- This makes your code more organized and manageable.
- It avoids repetition and makes code reusable!

## Built in functions

Out of the box, R comes with some very useful functions.

- You've already used some functions previously. Which ones?

### Hack time
Let's open the [Base R](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf) cheatsheet and hack together to get familiar with the basics!

## Packages or Libraries

When working on a project users will develop their own functions.
People will gather their functions into a library.
To access functions from other users, you need to install library using `install.packages()` function.
Once that is installed you can load it in memory with the `library()` function and start using the new functions.

### Hack Time!
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install the "ggplot2" library

# Load the library

# Make nice plot

```

## Make your own functions

As we saw previously, anyone can create functions.
This is the beauty of programming!

To make a function in R we use the `function()` function.


```{r eval=FALSE}
object_name <- function(arguments) {
  # A one line comment describing what the function does.
  output <- do_something()
  return(output)
}
```

Let's start making our own functions.

### Hack Time!
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create a function that prints your first and last name.

# Do some math inside a function and return the result.

# Combine what we learned to make a special mean function.

# Create an empty R script and put your functions inside.

#

```

# Embed Code
We now know some basics of R programming and how to create R scripts (`.R` files). We have also learned previously how to make and render RMarkdown files (`.Rmd`) into pdf or html files. For the most part, we ignored the code that was in `.Rmd` files.

Embedded code in `.Rmd` files comes in 2 flavours:

- Inline code: `r inline()`
- Code chunks: ` ```{r} ` and ` ``` `.

### Hack Time!

Let's head to RStudio and practice with embedded code.

1. Creating a new RMarkdown document in RStudio.
2. Look for embedded code.
3. Embed an inline code bit.
3. Embed a larger code chunk.
5. Render the document.
