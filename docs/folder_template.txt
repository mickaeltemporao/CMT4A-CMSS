Here is what each each item is responsible for:

- assets: This will store any images, plots, and other non-source files generated throughout the project.
- data: This will store our fake news data in both its raw (untouched from the original source) and processed (featurized or updated for our usecase) form.
- deploy: This will store any files needed for our deployment including Dockerfiles, etc.
- fake-news: This will store all the source for building, training, and evaluating our models.
- model_checkpoints: This will store the model binaries that we train and eventually want to deploy.
- notebooks: This will store any Jupyter notebooks used for any data analysis.
- scripts: This will store any one-off scripts for generating model artifacts, setting up application environments, or processing the data.
- LICENSE: Our software license.
- README.md: A high-level description of our project.
- requirements.txt: This will store the code dependencies for our project. This is a standard practice for Python-based projects, which our application will be.
